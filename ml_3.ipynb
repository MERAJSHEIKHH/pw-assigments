    "Ensemble Selection in boosting involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train Initial Models: Build a series of weak learners (e.g., shallow decision trees) sequentially, where each new model corrects errors from the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate Models: Assess the performance of each model on a validation set to determine how well it improves prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Best Models: Choose the most effective models based on their performance metrics. This could involve selecting models with the highest accuracy or lowest error.\n",

    "Combine Models: Aggregate the selected models into a final ensemble. In boosting, this typically means combining all the trained models rather than just a subset.\n",
